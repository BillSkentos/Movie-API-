    Docker is an app that helps you create in image of your program and deploy it using a docker container so that the users who access the app won't have to worry about package or infrastructure 
    independencies .
    
    To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

        *Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
        *Ubuntu Eoan 19.10
        *Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)
        *Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 (LTS)

     Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

    1. Use following commands to set up your repository .

         1. $ sudo apt-get update

         2.  $ sudo apt-get install \
            apt-transport-https \
            ca-certificates \
            curl \
            gnupg-agent \
            software-properties-common
